	                Hello world! I'm Thuy Nguyen. I am a creative Web Developer.  
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                I have great interest in new technologies since from a young age. However, since my young age, my parents has been guiding me to follow  health care career. I got my BS degree in Biological Science. After working for awhile, I realized that beside earning money, I want to enjoy my job too. Finally, I decided to push forward and pursue my interest as a Web Developer.

	            <p>
	                I am a fan of simplicity. I want my website to versatile, lightweight, and reflect the beauty of minimalism but fully interact with users.
